        My name is Tucker Vandament. I have recently started learning how to
        code in HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the past couple months now.
        Hopefully, this leads to me changing careers. For a little work
        background, almost all of my jobs have been centered around customer
        support. Whether that is from being a server/bartender, or working in
        tech support call centers with Dell and AT&T, to recently being a
        manager in retail. While the jobs have been good, I never truly felt
        challenged or fulfilled. While in college I was working towards a
        bachelors in Computer Science. It wasn't until recently that I started
        learning the beginning stages of front-end development, that I have
        throughouly enjoyed it.

        The purpose of this website is to showcase to myself the things I have learned.
        Whether that is through new features or techniques. On the website I hope to build a photo and video album
        showcasing me throughout the years, whether that is photos of just me or random things. I will include a recipe
        page, a place I will store recipes and add a list that will get said recipes allowing an easy way to remake 
        them in the future. Overall, I hope this will become a good foundation of my journey and will really show myself
        the things I have learned along the way.
