            My name is Tucker Vandament. I have recently started learning how to
            code in HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the past couple months now.
            Hopefully, this leads to me changing careers. For a little work
            background, almost all of my jobs have been centered around customer
            support. Whether that is from being a server/bartender, or working in
            tech support call centers with Dell and AT&T, to recently being a
            manager in retail. While the jobs have been good, I never truly felt
            challenged or fulfilled. While in college I was working towards a
            bachelors in Computer Science. It wasn't until recently that I started
            learning the beginning stages of front-end development, that I have
            thoroughly enjoyed it.

            The purpose of this website is to showcase to myself the things I have learned.
            Whether that is through new features or techniques. On the website I hope to build a photo and video album
            showcasing me throughout the years, whether that is photos of just me or random things. I will include a recipe
            page, a place I will store recipes and add a list that will get said recipes allowing an easy way to remake 
            them in the future. Overall, I hope this will become a good foundation of my journey and will really show myself
            the things I have learned along the way.
